Task

Using React and the Fake Store API, (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) build a checkout system where users can:

View items in cart
Increase item’s count
Reduce item’s count
Remove items from cart 
Clear cart
Pay for the total amount of the cart items (using Stripe and/or PayPal is an added advantage)

Note: items in cart should be persisted on page reload
